In this project, I designed and implemented a Remote Method Invocation (RMI) facility for Java. In 
other words, this facility provides a mechanism by which objects within one Java Virtual Machine 
(JVM) can invoke methods on objects within another JVM, even if the target object resides within a 
JVM hosted by a different, but network accessible, machine. It allows application developers to 

1. Name an object that reside among many hosts

2. Locate an object within many hosts


3. Marshall methods and their parameters 

4. Compile stub objects at runtime.
